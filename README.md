# Dealership-management

The project was carried out as a group, and the team is composed of Tedesco Mariapia and FrancescoAntonio Carbone.
In this project, we focused on managing a franchise network of car dealerships, specifically concentrating on both sales and rentals of vehicles. The project was divided into several key phases:

First, we conducted a conceptual analysis using an Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram to model the relationships and entities involved in the dealership processes. This provided a clear understanding of how different elements, such as customers, vehicles, sales, and rentals, interact within the system.

Next, we developed the database to store and manage all the relevant data. This database was designed to handle key processes such as vehicle sales and rentals efficiently.

Following that, we implemented the management of the sales and rental processes, ensuring that all transactions, from customer interactions to payment and contract management, were properly tracked and recorded in the system.

To improve user interaction, we built a web application using Python, providing an intuitive interface that allows users to easily manage vehicle sales, rentals, and other dealership operations. The app streamlined the workflow and enhanced the user experience.

We also focused on optimizations to improve the efficiency of various processes, such as minimizing rental times and optimizing inventory management for vehicles.

In terms of data analysis, we applied a star schema to structure the data for analytics purposes and created interactive dashboards using pivot tables in Excel. This enabled better insights into sales and rental trends and supported decision-making processes.

Finally, we converted SQL queries into MongoDB, ensuring that the system could work with non-relational databases, which added flexibility in handling large datasets and unstructured data.
